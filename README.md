# Cryptocurrencies
In this challenge a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, theyâ€™ve asked us to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We use what we learned with unsupervised machine learning to process and cluster cryptocurrency data so that we can reduce our dimensions then reduce the principal components using PCA for further analysis of the crypto market.
